Module 5 challenge repository for PyBer_Analysis





## Overview of the Analysis
After calculating various data about PyBer rides by City, we were asked to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. This included creating a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This written report will summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
It is not surprising that different "city types" (`Urban`, `Suburban`, and `Rural`) have different outcomes.  There is a large difference between the number of drivers, number of rides, and average fare for the three types.  The smaller `Rural` sites with the fewest drivers and rides collect a the largest fare per ride (on average) and largest fare per driver (on average). While the larger, `Urban` cities with 13 times the number of total rides and more than 30 times the drivers of the `Rural` areas understandably earn less than a third of the average fare per Driver

All three city types have dips and raises in the fare earned by week, and not always at the same time, showing that ridership is unique to each city type
